# MyCalendarCore
Calendar Application with .net Core

This app organizes your schedule instead of you..

I have used In-Memory database in this project. Because of that, I have initially added some sample data for runtime.

I have used n-tier architecture in order to separation of responsibilities.

-n-tier architecture.
  * Business
  * Data
  * Core
  * UI
  * Test (Unit test)
 
I have handled business stuff by repository pattern. 
All CRUD operations were implemented on the back-end side.
